## Module 0 - Initial Download and Setup

We'll be using Python 3.5.0 for this tutorial, get them at the link below:

For OS X: https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/

After you download it, double click on the package and click through the Python 3 installer.

## Module 1 - Pip and Virtual Environments

Python makes it simple to get new libraries using a tool called pip. With Python 3 it comes with the download. Use it just by typing this into terminal (replace library-name with the actual library):

** `pip install library-name`

You may also need prepend sudo to this command depending on your privileges.
